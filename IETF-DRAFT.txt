Quantum-Authenticated Neural Semantic                    Weaving
Protocol (QASWP)Abstract   The Quantum-Authenticated Neural Semantic
Weaving Protocol (QASWP) is   a communication protocol that integrates
quantum key exchange,   post-quantum cryptography, and neural-network-
based semantic data   compression. QASWP enables two parties to
establish a secure session   with quantum-generated shared keys and to
exchange data in a highly   compressed form based on shared context and
machine learning models.   The protocol provides mutual authentication
(leveraging quantum and   post-quantum methods) and ensures integrity
and confidentiality of   messages. It also introduces a novel quantum-
assisted context    synchronization mechanism and an optional zero-
knowledge proof   component for verifying AI model integrity. This
document specifies    the QASWP protocol, including the handshake
procedure, data    transfer format, security considerations, and
implementation notes.Status of This Memo   This Internet-Draft is

....................................... 231. Introduction   Quantum-
Authenticated Neural Semantic Weaving Protocol (QASWP) is an
experimental protocol that combines quantum cryptography and    machine-
learning-based semantic compression to achieve efficient,    secure
communication. QASWP is designed for scenarios where both    high
security (including post-quantum security) and bandwidth    efficiency
are desired, such as future quantum internet applications    or AI-
driven device communications.   The key features of QASWP are:   -
**Quantum key exchange for authentication and confidentiality**:
The protocol utilizes a quantum channel (e.g., entangled photon
pairs) to generate shared secret keys and to verify the absence of
man-in-the-middle attackers. These keys seed classical cryptographic
operations, providing forward security and resistance to quantum
computing attacks.   - **Neural semantic compression**: QASWP endpoints
share a pretrained      neural network model that can compress and
decompress messages by      focusing on their semantic content. By
sharing context, endpoints      only transmit information that is new or
unpredictable to the other      side, reducing message size.   -
**Context synchronization**: Both parties maintain a synchronized
context state (e.g., conversation history or shared knowledge) that
evolves as messages are exchanged. A novel mechanism uses quantum
shared randomness to help keep this context aligned.   - **Integrated
verification**: Optionally, QASWP includes a step for      exchanging
zero-knowledge proofs to assure each party that the      other is using
an authentic, unmodified compression model and      following the
protocol correctly, without revealing private details.   This document
specifies QASWP in an RFC-style format. Section 3    provides an
overview of how the protocol operates. Section 4    specifies the
handshake phase in detail, including message flows    and fields.
Section 5 covers the data transfer phase, defining the    message format
and compression process. Section 6 discusses security    considerations,
examining how QASWP defends against various threats.    Section 7
provides implementation guidance and notes on practical    deployment.
Finally, Section 8 and 9 address IANA considerations and    references,
respectively.   The reader is expected to be familiar with basic
cryptographic    concepts (encryption, digital signatures, etc.) and
with the notion    of quantum key distribution. Familiarity with
semantic communication    or neural network compression is beneficial
but not strictly required    to implement the protocol as specified.2.
Terminology   **Quantum Channel**: A communication channel capable of
transmitting    quantum states (qubits). In QASWP, the quantum channel
is used to    share entangled qubits or quantum bits between the two
parties. This    channel is assumed to be point-to-point (no
intermediate eavesdropper    can measure without detection).
**Classical Channel**: A traditional data channel (e.g., TCP/IP
connection) used to exchange classical messages (bits). The classical
channel in QASWP will be encrypted and authenticated once the session
is established.   **Endpoint / Party**: One side of a QASWP
communication session. We    often refer to endpoints as Alice
(initiator/client) and Bob    (responder/server) for clarity.
**Session**: A single instance of the QASWP protocol execution, from
handshake initiation to termination. A session is associated with
certain negotiated parameters (like cryptographic keys and model
context).   **Context**: The shared state or knowledge between endpoints
that is    used for semantic compression. Context may include past
messages,    environment knowledge, or the internal state of the
compression model    that both parties update in tandem.   **Semantic
Model**: A machine learning model (e.g., a neural network)    that both
endpoints use to encode (compress) and decode (decompress)    messages.
This model essentially defines a "language" or encoding    scheme based
on semantics.   **Compression Engine**: The component/procedure that
applies the    semantic model to produce compressed data from a message
or to    reconstruct a message from compressed data.   **Quantum Key
Exchange (QKE)**: The process by which two parties    use a quantum
channel to obtain a shared secret key. QKE in QASWP    typically refers
to the generation of a raw key via entangled qubits    and subsequent
classical post-processing (error correction and    privacy
amplification).   **Post-Quantum (PQ) Cryptography**: Classical
cryptographic    algorithms believed to be secure against quantum
adversaries (e.g.,    lattice-based encryption, hash-based signatures).
QASWP uses PQ    algorithms for authentication and as a fallback key
agreement.   **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)**: A cryptographic proof that
allows one    party to convince another that a certain statement is
true, without    revealing anything other than the truth of the
statement. In QASWP,    a specific form called zk-SNARK (Succinct Non-
interactive    Zero-Knowledge Argument) may be used to prove correctness
of model    use or computations.   **MAC (Message Authentication
Code)**: A short piece of information    (tag) that verifies the
integrity and authenticity of a message,    generated using a secret
key.   **AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data)**: An
encryption method that provides confidentiality and integrity
simultaneously. E.g., AES-GCM. QASWP uses AEAD to secure message
payloads on the classical channel.   **I-Frame / P-Frame (conceptual)**:
Borrowed from video compression    terminology for understanding context
resets, an "I-frame" would be    an independent message needing no prior
context, whereas a "P-frame"    uses previous context. In QASWP, most
messages are like P-frames    (context-dependent), with occasional
context resets akin to I-frames.3. Protocol Overview   QASWP operates in
two phases: the Handshake Phase and the Data    Transfer Phase.
**Handshake Phase**:    The handshake establishes a secure context for
communication:   - The peers first perform a Quantum Key Exchange (QKE)
by sending      and measuring entangled quantum bits. This yields a
shared random      secret and ensures no eavesdropper is present (if the
quantum      transmission is undisturbed).   - Using the output of QKE,
the peers engage in a classical exchange      to derive final session
keys and authenticate each other. This      involves:       * Exchanging
protocol version and capabilities (including which          semantic
model to use for compression).       * Optionally exchanging
certificates or identifiers and using a          post-quantum digital
signature or a pre-shared key for entity          authentication.
* Deriving encryption keys from the quantum secret and possibly
a parallel post-quantum key agreement (hybrid approach).       *
Optionally exchanging zero-knowledge proofs to attest to the
correctness of their semantic model or software.       * Confirming that
both parties have arrived at the same session          keys (via a key
confirmation MAC).   If any step of the handshake fails (e.g.,
verification checks fail or    an expected proof is invalid), the
session is aborted. On success,    both sides hold:   - A shared session
encryption key (and related keys for MAC if      separate).   - A
synchronized initial context for the semantic model (this could      be
just an "empty" context or include some agreed baseline knowledge).   -
Assurance of the peer's identity (if applicable) and that both are
in possession of the agreed model and keys.   The handshake is designed
to be complete in a few round trips. The    inclusion of quantum
exchange means an out-of-band process (entangled    photon transmission)
precedes or runs in parallel to the first    classical messages.
**Data Transfer Phase**:   Once the handshake is done, the parties can
send application data    securely. When sending a message:   - The
sender takes the message and inputs it into the Compression      Engine
along with the current context. The engine produces a      compressed
representation (a sequence of bits) which is typically      much smaller
than the original message.   - The sender encrypts this compressed
payload using the session key      (via an AEAD cipher). A header
(including sequence number, etc.)      is attached in plaintext or in
the AAD, and an auth tag is      generated.   - The receiver, upon
getting the encrypted packet, checks the auth      tag and decrypts it,
recovering the compressed payload.   - The receiver feeds the compressed
payload into its Compression      Engine with its context, obtaining the
reconstructed message.   - Both sender and receiver update their context
state based on the      message (so that future messages can be
interpreted relative to      this one).   In effect, each message
transmitted with QASWP is not standalone; it    is woven into the
semantic context that both sides share and update.   Additionally, QASWP
may utilize periodic quantum signals or other    sync methods to ensure
context alignment (for example, injecting a    known marker or resetting
context after a certain number of messages    if drift is a concern).
The Data Transfer continues until one or both parties decide to
terminate the session. A session can be terminated gracefully with a
closure alert (ensuring all remaining data and acknowledgments are
flushed), or abruptly if an error is detected.   Throughout data
transfer, security of each packet is maintained by    the
encryption/MAC, and the context ensures that even if packets are
observed, they are not intelligible without the model and context
state (which are private). Also, if an adversary tries to inject or
modify packets, the decryption/MAC verification will fail, and the
protocol should drop those packets (or abort if a serious breach is
detected).   QASWP does not itself guarantee reliable delivery (that is
typically    handled by an underlying transport like TCP or by an
application    layer). However, because the semantic encoding relies on
sequence and    context, it is generally expected to run on a reliable,
ordered    channel. If using an unordered or lossy transport (like UDP),
an    additional reliability mechanism or restricting QASWP to
idempotent    messages would be necessary.   In summary, QASWP aims to
achieve a secure channel similar to TLS    (protecting confidentiality
and integrity) while drastically reducing    the volume of data
exchanged by leveraging shared AI understanding    between the
endpoints. The quantum aspect ensures the security    cannot be
retroactively broken by quantum adversaries, and the    semantic aspect
aligns with an AI-native approach to communication.4. Handshake
Procedure   In this section, we define the handshake messages and steps
for QASWP.   The handshake can be conceptually divided into sub-phases:
1. Quantum Key Exchange (entangled qubit distribution and key
generation).   2. Classical Hello exchange (parameters and identities).
3. Classical key confirmation and proof exchange.   4. Handshake
completion (ready to send data).   The exact message flow is as follows:
```   (Quantum) : [ Entangled qubits sent and measured by both parties ]
Alice -> Bob: QASWP-ClientHello (classical)   Bob   -> Alice: QASWP-
ServerHello (classical)   Bob   -> Alice: QASWP-ServerFinished
(classical)   Alice -> Bob: QASWP-ClientFinished (classical)   ```
Optionally, the ServerHello or a subsequent handshake message may
carry proof data requiring an additional round trip (this is left
flexible in case the proof is large and needs to be segmented).   Below
we describe each part in detail:#### 4.1. Quantum Key Exchange   Before
or during the ClientHello/ServerHello exchange, Alice and Bob    perform
a quantum key exchange. This is not encapsulated in a TCP/IP    message
but occurs via a separate quantum communication process:   - Alice and
Bob establish a quantum link (through whatever means      their network
provides; this specification does not dictate how      the quantum link
is set up, only what is done with it).   - Over this link, they either
run a QKD protocol like BB84 or use      entangled pairs. In either
case, they obtain a raw sequence of      bits. They then perform
classical post-processing (error      correction and privacy
amplification) over an authenticated channel.     *Note:* Initially,
there is no authenticated channel, which is a      circular dependency.
In practice, QKD implementations use a small      pre-shared key or a
public-key signature to authenticate this      phase. QASWP assumes a
mechanism exists to authenticate the QKD      classical communication
(which could be as simple as each device      having the other's public
identity key from a certificate or a      short pre-shared secret).   -
The result of QKD is a shared key K_q (256 bits, for example). If
QKD fails (due to line disturbance or attack), the handshake      cannot
proceed under quantum security mode. The protocol may      either abort
or fall back to a purely classical key exchange      (depending on
configuration and policy).   Once K_q is established, both parties will
feed it into a key    derivation function (KDF) along with transcript
info. This yields    sub-keys for use in the next steps:   - K_auth = a
key for authenticating handshake messages (HMAC, etc).   - K_seed = a
key used as an input to the post-quantum KEM (if doing      hybrid,
maybe used to encrypt a PQ key).   - K_ctx  = seed for context
synchronization (could be used to derive      initial random context
values or initial model state tweaks).   - etc., as needed. All
derivations should be from a cryptographic      hash function (e.g.,
KDF(key=K_q, label="auth", transcript)).#### 4.2. Classical
Authentication and Key Confirmation   Once quantum key exchange is done
(or in parallel), the classical    handshake messages are exchanged:
**QASWP-ClientHello**:    This is the first classical message from Alice
to Bob.   It contains:   - Protocol version and a list of supported
options (e.g., supported      cipher suites, model IDs, proof
algorithms).   - A random nonce (to prevent replay).   - Alice's public
identity info:       * If using certificates: Alice's X.509 certificate
(which includes          her public signature key and identity).       *
If using raw public keys or preshared identities: an identifier
and the public key, or just an identifier if a PSK is known.   - A
commitment or identifier for the semantic model Alice proposes      to
use. This could be a hash of the model parameters or a well-known
model ID (if models are standardized).   - (Optionally) A zk-proof or a
placeholder for it. If Alice needs to      send a proof at handshake,
she might include it here if it's ready      (or in a later message).
- A digital signature covering the important parts of this ClientHello
(like the nonce, offered parameters, model ID, etc.), signed with
Alice's private identity key. The signature may be a post-quantum
scheme (preferred) or a hybrid signature that includes both a
classical and PQ signature for transition safety.   - A MAC (e.g., HMAC)
using K_auth (from quantum) over the whole      message (to authenticate
it at the bit level). This binds the      quantum key to this message.
The ClientHello thus provides Bob with Alice's identity and her
capabilities, and gives Bob assurance (via MAC with K_auth) that
Alice truly has the quantum key. The signature gives identity
authentication (if Bob trusts the certificate or PSK arrangement).
**QASWP-ServerHello**:    Bob replies with his own data:   - Protocol
version and selection of options (which cipher suite,      which model
ID to use from Alice's list, etc.).   - Bob's nonce.   - Bob's identity
info (certificate or identifier) similar to Alice's.   - A commitment or
identifier for the model (should match Alice's or      be chosen from
her proposals; if not, it indicates a negotiation      result).   -
(Optional) Bob's zk-proof or placeholder for it, if applicable.   -
Bob's digital signature covering both Alice's and Bob's nonces and
the handshake transcripts up to this point (to prevent tampering      or
parameter injection). Again, a PQ signature algorithm is used.   - A MAC
using K_auth over the message (to ensure integrity with      respect to
the quantum-derived key).   At this stage, both sides have exchanged
identities and preferences,    and know each other's public keys and
model choices. They also both    have K_q (quantum key) and have
verified the presence of the MACs,    meaning the quantum key was used,
hence no MITM on the quantum leg.   They now likely perform a **key
agreement** to get a final session    key:   - If using a post-quantum
KEM (e.g., Kyber): Alice might have included      a PQ public key in her
ClientHello. Bob now includes the KEM      ciphertext in his ServerHello
(which encapsulates a random key      K_pq). Alice will decapsulate it
to get K_pq. Now both have K_pq.   - If using Diffie-Hellman (classical
or PQ): could be similar, but      since we already have quantum key, a
Diffie-Hellman is optional or      purely for fallback.   - If using
only quantum: they might skip additional key exchange      and just use
K_q.   In any case, by end of ServerHello, both sides derive the final
session secrets:   - Master Secret = f(K_q, K_pq, transcripts) via a
secure KDF.   - From Master Secret, derive session encryption key,
session MAC key,      etc., using a PRF.   After sending ServerHello,
Bob can also send **ServerFinished**    immediately (to save a round
trip):   - ServerFinished contains a short value (e.g., 32-bit or
256-bit)      that is a verification tag (like a MAC or hash) over the
entire      handshake so far, keyed with the new session key. For
example,      an HMAC of all handshake messages using a key derived from
Master      Secret (this is analogous to TLS Finished message).   - This
assures Alice that Bob derived the same Master Secret and      that
everything is in order.   Alice, upon receiving ServerHello and
ServerFinished, will verify:   - Bob's signature (to authenticate
identity).   - Bob's MAC (to ensure integrity and that Bob had K_q).   -
The PQ KEM decapsulation (to get K_pq, if used).   - Compute Master
Secret and verify the ServerFinished tag.   If all checks out, Alice
considers the handshake almost complete.   Alice then sends
**ClientFinished**:   - Similar to ServerFinished, a tag over the
handshake (including      ServerFinished) keyed with Master Secret,
proving that she also      has the keys and that the handshake is
complete on her side.   - This is the final confirmation. After sending
this, Alice can send      encrypted data; Bob, upon receiving it and
verifying, can also      send data.#### 4.3. Model Negotiation and
Verification   Negotiating the semantic model is a unique aspect of
QASWP:   - The ClientHello lists one or more model identifiers or
versions      that Alice supports (and has the model files for).   - The
ServerHello picks one of those (or responds with an error/no      common
model if none match). All further communication will assume      that
model.   - Each model ID corresponds to a known architecture and
possibly      parameter set. The endpoints must ensure they actually
have the      same parameters. If the models are standardized (e.g.,
"Model      X v1.2" means a fixed weight set), then just agreeing on the
ID      is enough.   - If models can be custom or trained per user, then
a hash or      fingerprint of the model's parameters should be
exchanged. For      example, Alice could send H(M) of her model weights,
Bob checks      against H(M) of his model weights for that ID. If they
differ,      they do not actually have the same model and the session
should      abort or fall back (this protocol assumes identical models
are      present; it doesn't handle on-the-fly model transfer, which
would      be too heavy to do in handshake).   The verification via
zero-knowledge proof:   - If required (perhaps in high security mode),
Alice and Bob exchange      proofs that the model they claim to use is
indeed the one they      have loaded, and/or that they follow the
protocol. The details of      such proofs are beyond the scope of this
spec, but generally:       * The proof could show the knowledge of the
model's weights          corresponding to the hash they provided
(without revealing          them).       * Or a proof that a sample
input run through their encoder          produces a certain output
(proving correct functioning).     - These proofs, if used, might be
attached to ClientHello and        ServerHello, or might be sent in
separate messages if large.     - The protocol should allow for a
"Proof" message if needed:         Alice -> Bob: QASWP-ClientProof
Bob -> Alice: QASWP-ServerProof (or combined with Finished)     - If
proofs fail verification, the handshake fails.   In summary, by the end
of the handshake, both parties have:   - Authenticated each other (using
quantum and PQ methods).   - Agreed on a symmetric encryption key and
context for communication.   - Agreed on and verified a semantic model
to use for compression.   - (Optional) Verified via proofs that the
other side is honest in      the above.   Now the secure channel is
ready for use.5. Data Transfer Phase   After a successful handshake, all
further messages in the session    are encrypted and encoded according
to QASWP data format. This section    describes how application data is
handled in QASWP.#### 5.1. Message Encoding and Compression   Each
plaintext message to be sent through QASWP (which could be an
application-layer message like a JSON payload, a chat message, sensor
reading, etc.) undergoes the semantic compression process:   -
**Input**: plaintext message `M` and the current context `C` (which
both sender and receiver share from previous interactions).   -
**Encoding**: The sender's CompressionEngine uses the agreed model
to encode `M` in context `C`, yielding compressed data `Z`. This
may be a binary string of variable length.   - **Output**: `Z` is the
encoded form of `M`. The context state is      then updated: `C_new =
update(C, M)`. The sender will now consider      `C_new` as the context
for future messages.   On the receiving side:   - The receiver knows the
context `C` corresponding to all messages      prior to this one
(initially the context from handshake, then      updated as each message
comes in).   - **Decoding**: The receiver's CompressionEngine takes `Z`
and `C`      and decodes to reconstruct `M'` (the receiver's estimate of
the      original message). Ideally, `M'` equals `M` if the model and
context      are perfectly synchronized and the channel introduced no
errors.      Minor differences could occur if the model is lossy or
approximate,      but for most textual/data communications, it should be
exact or      acceptably close.   - The receiver updates its context:
`C_new = update(C, M')`. Because      `M'` should equal `M`
semantically, the context remains aligned      with the sender's new
context.   **Context Update Mechanics**:   - For deterministic contexts
(like conversation history), both sides      appending the message to
the history naturally syncs context.   - For neural network state, e.g.,
if using an RNN, both sides feeding      `M` into the RNN yields the
same new hidden state.   - If the model uses randomness (like dropout or
sampling), QASWP      ensures determinism by either using fixed random
seeds or the      quantum-synced random bits as common entropy so both
do the same      thing.   - The protocol may incorporate an explicit
context identifier or      version number in each packet, so the
receiver knows if it is      decoding with the correct context. For
instance, a context      version could be simply a message sequence
number if each message      updates context sequentially.   **Error
Handling**:   - If decryption fails (bad auth tag), the packet is
discarded and      considered an attack or corruption. The session might
be terminated      depending on severity.   - If decryption succeeds but
the receiver cannot decode `Z` (e.g.,      if `Z` is malformed or if
context was wrong), the receiver should      request a
resynchronization. This can be done by sending a special      control
message indicating context reset needed. One strategy is      to
reinitialize context to a checkpoint or ask the sender to resend
something in uncompressed form. These details are policy-specific
and not fixed by the protocol, but a simple approach is:       * If
decoding fails, abort the session (as it's likely out-of-sync
or an attack).       * Alternatively, have a "fall back to raw" flag:
the sender can          re-send the last message without compression if
it suspects          the receiver got out of sync.#### 5.2. Packet
Format   QASWP data packets (after handshake) have a specific format
sent    over the classical channel. We define the format in an abstract
sense (actual implementation could be binary or JSON, etc., but
ideally binary for compactness):   ```   0                   1
2                   3   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |
Seq Number (32 bits)          | Flags (8)     |  Context ID   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   |
Ciphertext Length (16 bits)   |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------------------------   |
Encrypted Payload (variable length)                         ...
+---------------------------------------------------------------+   |
Authentication Tag (e.g., 16 bytes for GCM)                 ...
+---------------------------------------------------------------+   ```
The above is one possible representation:   - **Sequence Number**: A
32-bit monotonically increasing counter for      each packet. This
ensures packets can be ordered and prevents      replay. This can also
double as the context version if each message      corresponds to one
update.   - **Flags**: 8 bits for control flags. Defined flags might
include:       * 0x01 = "Context reset" (indicates this packet's payload
is          encoded with a reset or fresh context, like an I-frame).
* 0x02 = "Proof attached" (indicates after the tag, a proof
structure follows).       * 0x04 = "Ack required" or other QoS
indicators as needed.       * Others are reserved.   - **Context ID**: 8
bits to identify which context or model is used      if multiple might
be in use (e.g., if in one session, two contexts      are interleaved,
or if different flows use different models). In      normal usage, this
can be 0 if there's only one context. It can      also help with re-
sync: if a context reset is sent, increment the      context ID so that
old out-of-sync messages are ignored.   - **Ciphertext Length**: 16-bit
indicating how long the encrypted      payload is. If the payload is
large, multiple packets might be      used or a higher bitsize could be
chosen (but semantic payloads      are usually small).   - **Encrypted
Payload**: This is the encryption of the compressed      data `Z`.
Encryption is done using an AEAD cipher with the session      key. The
associated data (which is not encrypted but authenticated)      should
include the header fields (Seq, Flags, Context ID, length)      so that
any tampering there is detected by tag verification.   -
**Authentication Tag**: Output of the AEAD cipher (e.g., 128-bit
tag for AES-256-GCM). Verifies both header and payload.   The packet is
transmitted over the existing classical channel (which    could be a TCP
socket, WebSocket, etc., depending on implementation).    Since QASWP
might run on top of an ordered transport, SeqNumber    duplication
checks are mostly for security (replay prevention). If    using an
unordered transport (not typical), Seq helps reorder.   The receiving
side on getting a packet will:   - Check Seq Number is as expected
(e.g., either exactly one more than      last seen or in a window if
parallel flows).   - Use the correct context state corresponding to the
Context ID and      current state to attempt decryption.   - Decrypt
with AEAD, verify tag using the session key and associated      data.
- If decryption fails or tag mismatch, discard (and possibly record
an error). Potentially, after a certain number of failures, abort
session (assuming an attack or irrecoverable desync).   - If decrypt ok,
retrieve `Z` (compressed data).   - Determine which context to use for
decoding `Z` (based on Context      ID and possibly the Flags if it’s a
reset).   - Decode `Z` to `M'`.   - Update context (for that Context
ID).   Note: The concept of multiple contexts or context ID is included
for    extensibility. A simple implementation can always use a single
context (ID = 0 for all messages). Multi-context might be used if,
for example, two independent data streams in one session each keep
their own semantic context (like two conversation topics).   If the
"Proof attached" flag is set, it means after the Auth Tag,    there is
additional data in the packet carrying a proof (likely    unencrypted or
separately handled). This is a special case for    sending zk-SNARK
proofs mid-session if needed. The format of that    proof data would be
defined when needed; presumably it includes a    length and the proof
bytes. The receiver would parse the proof after    verifying the main
packet, then verify the proof itself using the    appropriate
verification key or circuit.#### 5.3. Context Management   Context
consistency is vital for QASWP effectiveness. The protocol    includes
measures to maintain and, if needed, restore context sync:   - Each side
tracks the context state associated with the last      processed message
(or each context ID separately).   - The handshake established an
initial context (likely empty or a      known baseline).   - As each
message is processed, the context evolves deterministically      for
both parties.   Potential causes of context drift:   - Message loss
(shouldn't happen on reliable transport, but if it      does, the
receiver might miss an update).   - Message reordering (again unlikely
if ordered, but out-of-order      processing could desync if context is
applied in wrong order).   - A decoding error or discrepancy in model
state (if an edge case      or numerical issue made the model produce
slightly different      results on the two sides, though we try to avoid
that by design).   **Context Reset Mechanism**:   QASWP can perform a
context reset by transmitting an "I-frame" style    message. This would
typically be indicated by the Flags in a packet:   when the "Context
reset" flag is 1, it means the payload of that    packet is encoded
without reliance on prior context (or with a very    minimal baseline
context). Essentially, the sender reinitializes    their compression
model (or uses a fresh instance) for that message.    The receiver will
do the same before decoding it. After that message,    both will
continue from the new state.   When to reset:   - After a certain number
of messages or when context might be      saturating or no longer
providing benefit.   - When a possible sync issue is detected (like a
missed message).   - Or periodically, just as a safeguard (e.g., every
1000 messages or      when a new conversation topic starts).   Resets
help bound the damage if context gets out of sync — you    won't be lost
forever; a reset realigns things.   **Quantum context sync**:   If the
protocol is configured to use quantum-assisted context    sync, at
intervals the endpoints derive some fresh random data from    new
entangled qubits and feed that into the context. Practically:   -
Suppose every N messages, they perform a quick QKE of a few bits
(or repurpose some of the ongoing QKD key stream).   - They get a common
random value R.   - They both use R as a seed to perturb the model's
state slightly      in a known way (like resetting the model's random
generator seed      to R, or shuffling some internal representation).
- An attacker who is only on the classical channel does not know R
and thus cannot predict this context change or forge messages
around it.   - This further hardens against any adversary trying to
exploit      patterns; it also ensures that if contexts were diverging
due to      numerical issues, they are snapped back to a common
reference      regularly.   **Acknowledge and Flow Control**:   QASWP
does not inherently require acknowledgments at the protocol    level
(assuming underlying transport is reliable). However,    implementations
might use them for application logic or for    measuring context sync
(e.g., a simple ACK message like "got seq X"    could help double-check
both sides are aligned; these could be at    application layer).   If
using an unreliable transport, explicit ACK packets would be    needed
to implement retransmissions (but that essentially reimplements    a
reliability layer, which is beyond QASWP's scope).   **Maximum context
length**:   In some cases, the model might have limits (like context
window for    a transformer). If context grows too long (too many past
messages),    the protocol should either:   - Drop off older context
data (e.g., only keep last K messages).   - Or compress/summarize
context (like combine older messages into      a summary stored in
context).   The specifics depend on the model. The protocol doesn't fix
this,    but implementers should be aware to avoid unbounded memory
growth.   Finally, if a serious unrecoverable error happens (keys
mismatch,    context irreparably wrong), the parties should terminate
the session    and possibly start a new handshake if they want to
continue, rather    than continue with bad state.6. Security
Considerations   This section analyzes QASWP's security properties and
potential    vulnerabilities.   **Confidentiality**:    All user
messages are encrypted with strong symmetric encryption    (AES-256-GCM
or equivalent). The keys for encryption are derived    from a
combination of quantum and post-quantum processes, so an    attacker
would need to break both quantum key distribution and    the chosen
classical algorithms to recover plaintext. The semantic    compression
adds an additional obscurity layer: even if an attacker    got the
compressed bits (without keys), interpreting them requires    knowing
the exact model and context. That said, we do not treat    compression
as a security measure by itself (since through known    plaintext
attacks, an attacker might guess content if they somehow    recognized
patterns), so we rely on encryption as the primary    confidentiality
guarantee.   **Integrity and Authenticity**:   QASWP uses authentication
at multiple layers:   - The handshake messages are authenticated via
digital signatures      (for identity) and via HMAC tags derived from
the quantum key      (to ensure no alteration).   - Each data packet has
an AEAD tag to detect tampering or forgery.   If a packet is modified or
injected by an attacker, the receiver    will reject it due to tag
mismatch. Sequence numbers also help    detect replay or reordering
attacks.   **Authentication of parties**:   During handshake, assuming
the certificates or pre-shared keys are    properly managed, each party
verifies the other's identity. The    quantum exchange assures that the
person you're handshaking with is    indeed directly connected (no MITM)
because if it were not the real    Bob, the quantum test would fail (or
the classical MAC using K_q    would fail if MITM didn't have K_q).
Therefore, QASWP achieves mutual    authentication analogous to a TLS
full handshake, but with the added    trust that the keys come from
quantum measurements only the genuine    endpoints could produce.
**Post-Quantum Security**:   All cryptographic components are chosen to
be quantum-resistant:   - Symmetric 256-bit keys (safe from Grover's
algorithm which at      best gives sqrt speedup).   - Lattice-based or
hash-based signatures that are not known to be      breakable by
quantum.   - Optionally lattice-based key exchange (Kyber) in addition
to the      quantum keys.   Even if an attacker records the entire
session now, they should not    be able to decrypt it in the future,
because they would need the    one-time pad-like quantum key which they
could not have obtained    without detection, and/or break the lattice
crypto.   **Forward Secrecy**:   QASWP provides forward secrecy in that
the session keys are derived    from ephemeral quantum outcomes (and
optionally ephemeral PQ    exchange). If long-term keys (like identity
keys) are compromised    later, past session content remains safe. The
quantum key is used    immediately and then not stored; even if someone
somehow got a hold    of the classical transcript and your identity
keys, they couldn't    derive the session key without the quantum bits.
**Key Compromise Implications**:   - If the quantum key K_q is somehow
exposed (which would imply one      endpoint was compromised since an
eavesdropper can't get it      undetected), the attacker could
impersonate or decrypt that      session. But since there's a new
quantum exchange each session,      compromise doesn't affect future
sessions.   - If a party's long-term private key (for signatures) is
stolen,      the attacker could impersonate that party in future
handshakes.      This is mitigated if that party's certificate can be
revoked or      by using short-lived keys. Also, the attacker still
can't break      past sessions because they lack those sessions' K_q and
K_session.   - If the model information is stolen, an attacker might
guess what      messages might look like if they intercept encrypted
payloads and      brute-force some possibilities through the model.
However, without      the key to decrypt, they just have ciphertext.
Even with ciphertext,      trying to guess plaintext by model inversion
is extremely hard      (they would have to guess both context and
message correctly and      still wouldn't verify without the tag). So
model theft alone      doesn't break confidentiality, though it could
help an attacker      craft confusing messages if they ever got a
foothold to inject      plaintext (but they'd still fail the MAC if not
a full MITM).   **Resilience to MITM**:   The combination of quantum
eavesdropping detection and classical    authentication makes QASWP
robust against man-in-the-middle:   - If a MITM tries to intercept the
quantum exchange, the QBER      (quantum bit error rate) will spike and
the key will be aborted.   - If a MITM somehow let the quantum through
but then intercepted      the classical (which implies they also have
K_q, not possible      without detection), they'd still have to forge
signatures or      proofs to impersonate Alice and Bob to each other,
which would      fail if the real keys are known to each side.   - The
handshake MACs ensure the MITM can't modify handshake parameters
(like downgrading algorithms or changing model ID) without detection.
**Side-channels and Metadata**:   QASWP's semantic compression
potentially leaks some metadata: for    instance, the length of the
compressed payload might give hints    about the content (a very short
payload could indicate a predictable    message, etc.). An attacker
might guess that if every night the    compressed message is 5 bytes
long, perhaps it's the same routine    status update. To mitigate this,
padding can be used. The protocol    can allow some padding in the
plaintext before compression or in    the ciphertext to normalize
lengths. However, padding affects    compression efficiency.
Implementation can choose to pad all messages    to a fixed length
bucket if that is a concern.   Another potential issue is the model
could be susceptible to    adversarial inputs (like adversarial examples
in ML) or information    leakage. For example, if the model is poorly
designed, maybe an    attacker could craft a context and message that
cause the model to    output a known pattern in `Z` that they can
recognize even without    keys. We assume the model is not publicly
known to the attacker    (or even if architecture is known, the weights
are secret), and that    it doesn't have trivial output patterns.
Nonetheless, one should    evaluate models for such side channels. In
high security cases,    layering standard compression or encryption
might be advisable if    there's doubt (though we already encrypt after
compression, which    should hide any such patterns anyway).   **Denial
of Service (DoS)**:   The protocol has some expensive steps an attacker
could exploit:   - Quantum exchange: an attacker could bombard the
quantum channel      or try to cause high error rates, forcing repeated
retries. This      could degrade the system or waste resources. To
mitigate, systems      will likely have monitoring on QBER and abort
after too many fails.   - Proof verification: verifying zk-SNARK proofs
is relatively fast,      but generating them is slow. An attacker could
attempt to make      the honest party compute many proofs (if the
protocol required      responding to proof requests). In QASWP, proofs
are mainly in      handshake and possibly occasional, so not an
interactive DoS      vector per se. But this is something to watch:
e.g., not allowing      an unauthenticated user to trigger heavy proof
generation.   - Large messages or contexts might be used to exhaust
memory. QASWP      can mitigate by setting limits on message size and
context length,      and by using streaming if big data must be sent
(though sending      large raw data defeats semantic compression
benefits; QASWP is      better for message-oriented data).   - The
handshake itself requires some computation (signatures, KEM
decaps). If an attacker initiates many handshakes and drops them,
it could cause load. Rate limiting or puzzles can be applied at      a
higher level if needed.   **Quantum-specific attacks**:   One must
consider that the security of the quantum channel is    hardware-
dependent. E.g., an attacker might exploit device    vulnerabilities
(detector blinding attacks in QKD hardware, etc.).    Those are outside
the protocol spec's scope but implementers need to    use quantum
hardware that has countermeasures for known issues and    follow QKD
standards (like ITU-T recommendations for QKD security).   **Privacy**:
QASWP by itself doesn’t incorporate anonymity or traffic analysis
resistance beyond encryption. Identities are revealed in handshake
(certificates). If anonymity is needed, one could integrate QASWP
with an anonymity network or use pseudonymous keys. The semantic
compression might actually reduce distinguishability of traffic
(since everything is encoded to what looks like pseudorandom bits
after encryption). All messages after handshake are uniform encrypted
packets. However, an observer could still note the timings and sizes
of packets. Padding and timing obfuscation would be needed for    high-
level traffic analysis resistance.   In summary, QASWP is designed to be
**secure against passive and    active attackers** who have up to full
control of the classical    network but (presumably) cannot undetectably
interfere with the    quantum channel. The combination of quantum and
post-quantum methods    ensures long-term confidentiality. The main
security reliance is on    the proper implementation of these methods
and the correctness of    the shared model.7. Implementation Notes
This section provides guidance for implementers regarding integration,
performance tuning, and interoperability.   **Model Distribution**:
Both parties need the same semantic model (neural network) in
advance. This could be handled in several ways:   - Out-of-band: The
model is installed on devices beforehand (for      example, two IoT
devices might each be flashed with the same      compression model
tailored to their application).   - Download during handshake: If models
are versioned and relatively      small, one side could send the model
to the other if needed.      However, many models (with weights) can be
tens of megabytes, not      feasible to send in a handshake. Better to
have it pre-shared or      referenced by an ID.   - Model selection: If
multiple models exist for different domains      (text vs. image, etc.),
ensure the protocol negotiates the right      one. Possibly the
handshake "supported models" list should include      a domain or type
as well.   **Quantum Channel Integration**:   The implementation of
QASWP will typically run on top of a classical    transport (like TLS
runs over TCP). The quantum channel is separate.    One approach is to
treat the QKD system as a black box that supplies    keys. For example,
the code could call into a quantum key supplier    library that yields
K_q and a flag indicating if the quantum    transmission was clean. This
decouples the specifics of quantum    hardware from the rest of QASWP
stack.   Synchronization: The quantum exchange might not be
instantaneous    relative to network messages. Implementation might
start the QKD    process and concurrently proceed with some handshake
steps but    cannot complete handshake until K_q is ready. This suggests
a    multi-threaded or event-driven design where handshake waits on
quantum readiness.   Also consider failure modes: if quantum key
generation fails (maybe    due to line conditions), implementation could
either fall back to    classical or try again or abort according to
configuration.   **Memory and State**:   The context state for the model
should be stored and updated    carefully. If multithreading, ensure no
two threads send messages    on the same session concurrently or else
context updates might race.    Probably enforce that only one message at
a time is being encoded or    have a queue.   The model itself (neural
net) might use a lot of memory. If devices    have limited RAM, consider
using smaller models or quantized    versions (8-bit weights instead of
32-bit) to trade a tiny bit of    compression efficiency for memory.
If multiple sessions run in parallel (with different contexts each),
you'll likely need separate model instances or at least separate
context state per session. Sharing the same model weights is fine,
but each session must track its own hidden state.    **Performance
optimizations**:   - Use hardware crypto: AES-GCM, SHA-3, etc. use CPU
or hardware      accelerators (many platforms have these).   - If a
large portion of CPU is spent in neural model inference,      consider
using a machine learning accelerator or GPU if available.      Some IoT
devices might not have that, so then ensure the model is      small.
There's a balance: a bigger model compresses better (fewer      bits on
network) but uses more CPU.   - Possibly allow adjustable compression
levels: e.g., a device can      decide to only partially compress if
it's under heavy load (like      skip one step of refinement in encoding
to save CPU). This could      be a negotiated parameter or even dynamic
(with a flag indicating      "low compression mode" temporarily). The
other side would need to      know how to decode accordingly, so it's
not trivial to change on      the fly without pre definition.
**Interoperability and Versioning**:   QASWP is versioned (the protocol
itself has a version number in    ClientHello). If future versions
change handshake or fields, the    version negotiation should ensure
only matching versions proceed.   If different implementations support
different cipher suites or    model sets, the negotiation in handshake
should handle it gracefully    (if no common cipher or model, they must
abort with a clear error).   Ideally, maintain an IANA registry (see
below) for QASWP cipher    suites (quantum+PQ algorithm combos) and
model IDs (maybe a namespace    or URN for model references).   Because
the field sizes for lengths and sequence numbers are fixed    in the
spec, be mindful of their limits (e.g., SeqNumber 32-bit will    wrap
after 4 billion messages; in a long-running session that might
actually happen if sending hundreds of messages per second for years,
so one should handle wrap-around or renegotiate keys before that).
**Error Handling**:   If something goes wrong (bad MAC, decode failure,
proof invalid, etc.):   - The implementation should send an alert and
abort the session.      Perhaps define an "Alert" message type (similar
to TLS Alert) with      codes like BadRecordMAC, DecompressionFail, etc.
- Once an error is detected and an alert is sent/received, the
session keys should be discarded and no further communication
allowed on that session.   Logging: For debugging, it helps if an
implementation can log whether    an error was due to cryptographic
failure vs model decode failure.    But be careful not to reveal
sensitive info in logs (like key    material or plaintext).   - In
particular, if a proof fails, log it but also consider it could      be
an attack (someone trying to pass a wrong proof).   **Testing**:   It's
advisable to test QASWP components independently:   - Test quantum key
integration with a simulator if real hardware      isn't available
(simulate a random key and some error rate).   - Test compression
separately on sample data to ensure the model      yields correct
results and that encoding-decoding is lossless for      what it needs to
be.   - Test the entire handshake flow with various parameter choices
and      check that keys match, context aligns.   - Fuzz test the packet
parsing and state machine to ensure no      unexpected input can crash
it or break out (especially because      we've introduced a fairly
complex state machine).   - Interop test between two independent
implementations (if any) to      ensure the spec is followed correctly.
**Fallback modes**:   If configured, QASWP can operate without a quantum
channel (pure    classical). This basically turns it into a TLS-like
handshake using    just PQ algorithms and then the same semantic layer.
For testing    or early deployments (where quantum links are rare), this
mode    might be used. But the security then relies entirely on the PQ
crypto.   Implementations might allow a flag "quantum_required". If true
and    quantum is not available or fails, then session aborts. If false,
it will do its best with what’s available.   Similarly, one could allow
disabling the SNARK proof requirement    for performance if both sides
agree (perhaps indicated by a    "Proofs: none" in handshake).   These
toggles should be clearly logged or indicated to avoid a false    sense
of security (e.g., know when you're not actually using quantum    keys
or skipping proofs).   **Use of standard libraries**:   For
cryptography, use established libraries (OpenSSL, libsodium,    PQCrypto
libs, etc.) especially for things like Dilithium, Kyber    which might
be tricky to implement from scratch correctly.   For zero-knowledge
proofs, if implementing that part, one could use    libraries like
libsnark or zk-SNARK frameworks, but that requires    setting up
circuits and keys. It's complex and might be beyond many    use cases
initially, so an implementer could decide to omit the    proof feature
in a first version or use a simpler approach (like    just verifying
model hash by trust rather than ZKP).   **Hardware considerations**:   -
Quantum transceivers might be external devices. The implementation
might interface via an API to that hardware. Ensure this
communication is secure (because if an attacker can fake being the
QKD device, they'd feed known keys, etc. - unlikely scenario but
just ensure authenticity of the quantum device output).   - If the
environment is such that quantum channel is short-range      (like
within the same building), the implementation might skip      certain
heavy identity checks if physically secure. But generally      it's
better not to skip just in case.   - On constrained devices, consider if
the overhead of QASWP is worth      it. For very simple sensors, a tiny
model might not compress much      and could be overkill. QASWP shines
when there's redundancy to      exploit and security to enforce.8. IANA
Considerations   This document defines a new protocol but does not yet
specify    particular IANA registries. Potentially, if QASWP were to be
assigned    a standard port number, an IANA assignment would be needed.
For example, if running directly over UDP or TCP, one might request:   -
TCP port XXX for QASWP (this would allow easier firewall
identification).   However, QASWP could also be used as a TLS-like
mechanism on any port    or as part of an application protocol, so a
dedicated port is not    mandatory.   Additionally, if the protocol were
standardized, IANA registries    could be created for:   - QASWP Cipher
Suite IDs (each combination of quantum key method +      KEM + signature
+ cipher could have an ID).   - QASWP Model IDs (if standardized models
are enumerated).   - QASWP Named Groups or other constants.   As of this
version, no codepoints are formally requested from IANA.9.
