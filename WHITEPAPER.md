*Author: Nikolai Nedovodin (CPUTER Inc.), October 2025*

## Abstract

We introduce **Quantum-Authenticated Neural Semantic Weaving Protocol (QASWP)**, a novel communication protocol that integrates quantum cryptographic authentication with neural **semantic weaving** for efficient and secure data exchange. QASWP leverages quantum key distribution and entanglement to establish provably secure session keys and authenticate endpoints, while using neural networks to compress and predict semantic content of messages. By transmitting **meaning** instead of raw data, QASWP dramatically reduces bandwidth requirements – semantic encoding prioritizes task-relevant information to eliminate redundant bits:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. The protocol includes a zero-knowledge verification layer (zk-SNARKs) to ensure the integrity of AI-generated content and model compliance without revealing private data. We detail QASWP’s cryptographic architecture, mathematical foundation, compression algorithms, and context synchronization mechanism. Our analysis shows that QASWP achieves quantum-resistant security and significant compression gains, aligning with emerging **quantum-aware semantic communication** paradigms:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. We provide performance evaluations, discuss implementation considerations, and position QASWP relative to related work in quantum networking and semantic communication. The results indicate that QASWP can enable a new class of **intelligence-native** communication systems that are secure against quantum adversaries and adept at context-driven information exchange.

## Introduction

Modern networks face twin revolutions: the advent of quantum computing threatens classical cryptography, and the rise of AI-driven applications demands more **meaning-centric** communication. Conventional protocols transmit raw data streams, incurring overhead by sending information that the receiver often already infers from context. Meanwhile, quantum computing advances jeopardize encryption algorithms, necessitating **quantum-resistant** or quantum-based security. Bridging these challenges, researchers have envisioned **intelligent, context-aware networks** that prioritize semantic content and integrate quantum channels:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. QASWP operates at this nexus of **quantum cryptography** and **semantic communication**.

**Quantum** channels (e.g., entangled photon links) provide theoretically secure key exchange and eavesdrop detection based on quantum physics. **Semantic communication** uses AI models to focus on the meaning of messages rather than bit-level representations, thereby reducing bandwidth by sending only what is new or unpredictable given the shared context:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Recent 6G research highlights semantic encoding as a means to reduce communication redundancy and calls out “quantum-aware semantic channels” as a promising direction:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. QASWP is one of the first protocols to realize this direction by tightly coupling a quantum authentication layer with a neural semantic compression layer.

Furthermore, as AI systems take on greater roles in generating and interpreting data, trust in their outputs becomes critical. QASWP incorporates **zero-knowledge proofs** (specifically zk-SNARKs) to verify computational integrity of the AI components. This ensures that both parties can trust the neural semantic transformations (e.g. compressed representations or predictions) without directly exchanging raw model details. By combining these elements, QASWP addresses three key needs simultaneously: **security** against quantum-era threats, **efficiency** via semantic compression, and **trustworthiness** of AI-driven communications.

This paper provides a deep dive into QASWP. Section 2 reviews background and related work in quantum authentication, semantic communication, and verifiable AI. Section 3 presents the overall architecture of QASWP, detailing its layers and components. Section 4 covers the cryptographic framework, including quantum key exchange and post-quantum digital signatures. Section 5 describes the neural semantic weaving model, including mathematical formulations of the compression and context synchronization. Section 6 discusses the integration of zk-SNARKs for AI verification. Section 7 evaluates performance, analyzing bandwidth compression, latency, and security overhead. Section 8 compares QASWP with related protocols and frameworks. Finally, Section 9 concludes with potential applications and future research directions.

## Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Quantum Key Distribution and Authentication

**Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** protocols (e.g., BB84) use quantum phenomena to let two parties generate a shared secret key with security guaranteed by physics. Any eavesdropping on the quantum channel introduces detectable disturbances. QKD, however, does not inherently authenticate the identities of the participants – a classical authentication step is required to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}. Traditionally, QKD implementations rely on pre-shared secrets or public-key signatures to authenticate the classical channel that reconciles and confirms the keys:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}. This need for classical authentication is a known practical challenge in deploying QKD:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.

Recent efforts have sought to strengthen authentication in quantum settings. For example, Wang (2025) proposes the **Quantum Good Authentication Protocol (QGP)**, which combines a quantum photonic channel for key distribution with a post-quantum digital signature (Dilithium) for authentication:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. QGP effectively adds a “Layer 0” below the OSI model to handle quantum transmissions and uses lattice-based cryptography at the application layer:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}. This hybrid approach ensures that even if quantum computers break classical RSA/ECDSA, the protocol remains secure using quantum keys and PQ signatures. QASWP builds on these ideas: like QGP, it uses a quantum channel to bootstrap security and employs post-quantum cryptographic primitives. However, QASWP goes further by incorporating semantic compression and AI verification, which were not addressed in QGP.

Another relevant concept is **Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS)**, which use quantum states to achieve signature-like authentication of messages. QDS schemes allow a sender to distribute quantum states that recipients can use to verify message authenticity and origin, with unconditional security in theory. While promising, current QDS implementations face challenges in storage and transmission of quantum states over long distances. QASWP does not directly implement QDS, but the idea of quantum-assisted authentication motivates its design. Specifically, QASWP’s handshake includes a quantum exchange that both secures the key and implicitly confirms both parties’ presence (since an attacker cannot perfectly intercept quantum states undetected). This ties identity verification into the physical layer of communication.

### 2.2 Semantic Communications and Neural Compression

Conventional data compression (e.g., ZIP for text, JPEG for images) reduces redundancy at the syntactic level (bits and bytes) but does not understand meaning. **Semantic communication** is a paradigm where transmitted information is tailored to what the receiver needs or expects, leveraging AI to send **only the semantic content** that isn’t already shared or inferable. In other words, the goal is to transmit *meaning* rather than raw data. This concept is gaining traction in the context of next-generation (6G) networks and AI-native communication systems:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. *Semantic encoding* techniques have been shown to drastically cut down data rates by focusing on task-relevant features of the message:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. For example, instead of sending a full image for classification, a semantic communication system might send only the features or labels needed by the classifier on the other end.

Several frameworks exemplify this approach. **DeepSC** (Deep Semantic Communication) and related models use neural networks (often autoencoders or transformers) to encode messages (sentences, images) into compact vectors, which are transmitted and decoded at the receiver. These systems have demonstrated that significant compression is achievable for specific tasks (e.g., text transmission for language understanding) while maintaining fidelity on the task’s outcome. However, many of these are still experimental – as of 2025, implementations like DeepSC have mostly been validated in simulations or limited testbeds:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. Real-world deployment issues include the need for robust model synchronization between parties, coping with unpredictable inputs, and the computational cost of running neural models on edge devices.

Another relevant concept is **semantic feedback** – the receiver (or the task’s context) can influence what is sent next. If the receiver’s AI can predict what the sender is likely to transmit, the sender can omit what would be predictable and send only the unpredictable parts. This idea, sometimes called **goal-oriented communication**, ties closely into QASWP’s design for context weaving. By maintaining a synchronized context (a history or state of the conversation/task), both sides effectively share an implicit understanding that reduces the need for explicit data transfer. Only new information (with respect to that shared context) is transmitted. This is related to the information-theoretic concept of *conditional entropy*: QASWP aims to send data proportional to the entropy of the message *given the current shared context*, rather than the entropy of the raw message itself.

In practice, QASWP’s **CompressionEngine** component (Section 5) implements a learned compression model. Neural network architectures used for semantic compression include variational autoencoders (VAEs) for continuous data and transformer-based sequence models for text. These models are trained (offline) on representative data so that they learn to encode inputs into a dense latent representation that captures meaning. The decoder on the other end reconstructs the message from this latent code, aided by having the same context. Because both sides run the same model and start from a synchronized context, the communication can sometimes resemble *language* between the AIs – a language optimized for their shared task and understanding.

### 2.3 Verifiable Computation and zk-SNARKs for AI

As systems delegate more decision-making to AI, a challenge arises: **how can one party trust the computations performed by another party’s AI model?** For instance, if Alice sends Bob a compressed semantic representation, Bob needs to trust that Alice’s encoding was produced by a legitimate model and corresponds to the intended message. If Bob also runs a model (to decode or predict Alice’s messages), Alice might want assurance that Bob’s model follows the agreed protocol and hasn’t been tampered with (especially if Bob’s model influences actions affecting Alice). These concerns motivate incorporating **verifiable computation** into the protocol.

Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (**zk-SNARKs**) offer a powerful tool in this regard. A zk-SNARK allows one party to prove to another that a certain computation was carried out correctly, without revealing the inputs or internal details of that computation. In context of QASWP, zk-SNARKs can be used to prove statements like: “*The message I just sent was encoded by a neural model with hash H, and it decodes to meaningful content X given the shared context*” or “*I ran the agreed-upon algorithm on our shared data and got result Y*”. The verification is done by checking a succinct proof, which is typically only a few hundred bytes, even for large computations.

However, directly applying zk-SNARKs to modern neural networks is non-trivial. Modern models (like Transformers or CNNs) have millions of parameters and many non-linear operations, which translate into large arithmetic circuits for SNARK proving. Recent research confirms that naive SNARK verification of deep neural network inference is computationally heavy:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. Each layer and neuron introduces constraints that blow up proving time and memory. To mitigate this, techniques such as **model sparsification** and optimized constraint design have been proposed:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. For example, the *TeleSparse* approach (Maheri *et al.*, 2025) prunes neural network weights and optimizes activation functions to simplify the corresponding SNARK circuits, cutting proof generation time nearly in half with minimal accuracy loss:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.

QASWP incorporates zk-SNARKs in a targeted way to balance trust and efficiency. Rather than proving every neural network operation for every message (which would be impractical), QASWP uses SNARKs during the **handshake and setup phase** (see Section 6 and 7). During handshake, each side generates a proof that *“I possess a valid model (and possibly a secret key) that will be used for encoding/decoding or interpreting messages.”* This might involve proving that the model’s parameters have a known commitment or that a small sample input produces an expected output under their model (a form of remote attestation). These proofs ensure both parties that they are running the genuine protocol software and model, not a malicious variant. After this mutual verification, subsequent message exchanges can be trusted to follow the protocol (assuming the cryptographic keys ensure no interference by third parties). Additionally, QASWP could allow on-demand proof requests if something suspicious is detected (for example, if a decoded message doesn’t semantically match expectations, one party might request a proof of correctness for that particular message encoding).

In summary, zk-SNARKs in QASWP provide a **trust layer** on top of the semantic communication layer. They complement the lower-level security (quantum keys and encryption) by addressing a higher-level concern: “Even if the channel is secure, how do I trust what I’m receiving *makes sense* and was generated correctly?” The use of succinct proofs allows this trust to be established without exchanging large amounts of internal data (which could compromise privacy or IP of the model). This approach is aligned with broader trends of **verifiable AI (ZK-ML)**, where one can verify AI decisions or computations in critical applications.

## QASWP Architecture Overview

*(Figure 1: High-level architecture of QASWP, showing the interaction of quantum and classical channels, and the flow through cryptographic and AI modules.)*

QASWP is a multi-layer protocol combining a quantum communication layer with a classical semantic layer. **Figure 1** conceptually illustrates the architecture. At the lowest layer, a quantum channel provides entangled qubits or quantum states between the two parties (traditionally called Alice and Bob). This quantum layer is used during handshake to perform authentication and key exchange. Above it, a classical channel (e.g., over TCP/IP) carries the actual data packets of the session – however, these packets are not raw user data but **semantic packets** that contain compressed representations and any required metadata (like proof tokens or integrity checks). The classical channel is secured by symmetric encryption using keys derived in the handshake. At the highest layer, each endpoint has an **Application AI Agent** which interfaces with the user or higher-level application. This agent uses a **ContextWeaver** module to maintain conversational or data context and a **CompressionEngine** (with a neural model) to encode outgoing messages and decode incoming ones. The **ProofVerifier** module is available to generate or check zk-SNARK proofs as needed (especially during setup).

Key components of QASWP include:

- **Quantum Key Exchange & Authentication:** Utilizes quantum signals to establish shared random secrets and to verify the presence of the legitimate peer. This component yields a high-entropy shared secret key and possibly a small authentication tag or indicator if tampering was detected.

- **Post-Quantum Handshake (Classical):** A sequence of classical messages that authenticate the parties (using digital signatures or a Message Authentication Code) and confirm the negotiated parameters (like which AI model or compression level to use). This handshake uses the output of the quantum exchange as one input (e.g., for one-time pad encryption or keyed MAC) and also establishes any additional post-quantum keys (for backup security or future use).

- **Semantic Compression/Decompression Module:** Realized by the **CompressionEngine** and **ContextWeaver**, this module is responsible for transforming high-level messages into compact encodings. It interacts with the context state (maintained by ContextWeaver) to exploit prior shared information. For example, if the context indicates both sides know “topic = weather,” a message about temperature can be sent with minimal bits since the topic is implicit.

- **Context Synchronization (Quantum-Assisted):** QASWP ensures both parties’ context states remain aligned. This is partly achieved by design (both parties simulate the same context updates as messages are exchanged), and partly reinforced by periodic quantum signals. The quantum layer can deliver *fresh randomness* or *signals* that both sides use to reset or adjust context in lockstep. We call this mechanism **quantum-layer context sync**. Importantly, this does *not* mean sending classical context data over quantum – instead, it uses the correlations of entangled states to inject identical random seeds or flags into both agents’ context, in a way an eavesdropper cannot predict or influence. We detail this in Section 5.3.

- **Encryption and Integrity Layer:** All semantic packets on the classical channel are encrypted (using AES-GCM or similar AEAD cipher) with the session key derived from the handshake. This provides confidentiality and integrity. Even though the semantic compression already obfuscates raw data, encryption is still necessary to prevent an adversary from learning any information from the compressed bits or manipulating them. The overhead for encryption is relatively small and is well-justified given the high level of security required.

- **Proof Exchange and Verification:** If the protocol is configured in high-assurance mode, during handshake the parties exchange succinct proofs (SNARKs). These are sent as part of classical handshake messages (which may be several kilobytes to accommodate the proofs). The **ProofVerifier** at each end checks the other’s proof. Only if verification passes do they proceed. Optionally, proofs might also be used during the session (for example, appended to a critical message) if additional verification is needed for specific transactions.

**Protocol workflow:** In a typical QASWP session setup, first a quantum entanglement is established (this could be via a direct fiber link, a satellite link distributing entangled photon pairs, or any quantum network service). Both sides perform measurements on the entangled particles to produce correlated random sequences and perform QKD post-processing (error correction and privacy amplification) to obtain a shared secret key. Immediately after, the classical handshake begins: one side (the initiator) sends a **ClientHello** message containing a fresh post-quantum public key (if using KEM), its identity (or certificate), a commitment to the AI model or context parameters it will use, and a SNARK proof attesting to that model/parameters. This ClientHello is authenticated – for example, part of it may be encrypted or MACed with the quantum-derived key, and it may also be signed with the initiator’s private signing key. The responder replies with a **ServerHello** containing its own public key, identity info, chosen session parameters (which could include selecting a model or indicating acceptance of the client’s choices), and its own proof. The ServerHello also contains a MAC or signature that covers both messages to bind the handshake. Both sides verify each other’s proofs and signatures. If everything checks out, they then perform a final confirmation exchange (to ensure no tampering occurred in transit – similar to a TLS Finished message using derived keys). At this point, a secure session is established, with both parties sharing:
1. A symmetric session key (or keys) for encryption.
2. A shared initial context for the semantic model (the context might start as empty or a predetermined baseline, now augmented with any agreed parameters or sync data).
3. Assurance of each other’s identity and protocol compliance (thanks to the proofs and signatures).

Once the session is up, application data can be exchanged. When one side (say Alice) wants to send a message (e.g., a sentence, a sensor reading, etc.), the following happens:
- The **ContextWeaver** at Alice takes the current context (which encapsulates relevant history and shared knowledge) and the new message. It “weaves” these together by feeding them into the neural compression model (within the CompressionEngine). This generates a compact representation `Z` for the message relative to the context.
- Alice’s CompressionEngine may also output some meta-info like an error-check code or a confidence level. The context state is then updated to include the fact that this message was sent (ensuring future messages will be conditioned on it).
- The representation `Z` is then encrypted with the session key. Let’s call the ciphertext `C`. A header is added (containing sequence number, any necessary model info, etc.), and an authentication tag is appended (if using AEAD encryption).
- Alice sends the resulting **semantic packet** over the classical channel to Bob.
- Bob receives the packet, verifies the auth tag and decrypts it to recover `Z`. Bob’s ContextWeaver (which has the same prior context) feeds `Z` into the decoder part of the neural model, reproducing Alice’s message (or an approximation of it) as `M'`. Given proper synchronization, `M'` should match the original `M` or be very close in meaning.
- Bob updates his context state with `M'` (which should also align with Alice’s updated context).
- Optionally, Bob’s side could generate a quick acknowledgment or perform a context consistency check. For example, Bob might hash the updated context and send that hash encrypted back to Alice to confirm they are still in sync.

This cycle repeats for subsequent messages in either direction. The context grows and evolves, enabling deeper compression over time as more shared information accumulates (up to model limits). Periodically, the protocol may refresh keys or context using new quantum transmissions or by falling back to classical re-keying (to ensure long-term security and sync).

### Roles and Modes

QASWP can operate in different modes:
- **Client-Server mode:** where one side initiates (client) and the other responds (server). This is suitable for typical request-response applications (IoT device sending data to cloud, or a user messaging a service).
- **Peer-to-Peer mode:** where either party can initiate and the protocol is more symmetric. In this case, the first to act takes the “client” role briefly for handshake, but afterward both are equal peers. This fits scenarios like two agents collaborating or a mesh network of nodes.
- **Offline/Store-and-forward mode:** QASWP primarily assumes an interactive quantum link for handshake, but if a direct quantum link isn’t continuously available, one could distribute entangled qubits beforehand (or use a trusted repeater network). In such cases, the actual message exchange might happen later. The context sync via quantum would then be done in batches or at certain checkpoints.

The protocol also allows a **fallback** to pure post-quantum classical operation if the quantum channel fails or is unavailable. In fallback, the handshake would use a post-quantum key exchange (like CRYSTALS-Kyber) to derive a session key and rely on classical authentication (like Dilithium signatures or a pre-shared key). Communication would still use the semantic compression and SNARK verification. While this loses the unconditional security of the quantum layer, it maintains the rest of QASWP’s benefits and remains quantum-resistant.

## Cryptographic Architecture and Key Exchange

At its core, QASWP provides **end-to-end encryption and authentication**, enhanced by quantum techniques. We now detail the cryptographic steps in the handshake and data transfer, referencing the standard cryptographic primitives employed.

### 4.1 Quantum Exchange for Shared Secrets

**Entangled Qubits:** QASWP assumes that during handshake, Alice and Bob either generate or receive pairs of entangled qubits. For instance, a photon source can emit entangled photon pairs sent to Alice and Bob. When measured in a chosen basis, these produce correlated random bits known only to Alice and Bob. Using protocols like BB84 or E91 variants, Alice and Bob perform multiple such measurements. They publicly communicate a subset of results to estimate the quantum bit error rate (QBER) — if an eavesdropper (Eve) was interfering, the QBER will exceed a threshold, and the protocol aborts for security. If QBER is acceptable, they proceed to error correction (reconciling any measurement differences via a classical algorithm, often using information reconciliation codes) and **privacy amplification** (applying a hash function to the corrected bits to shrink them and eliminate any partial information Eve might have). The output is a shared secret key `K_quantum` of, say, 256 bits, which is information-theoretically secret from any eavesdropper.

**Quantum Authentication:** In addition to providing a key, the successful low-error quantum exchange implicitly authenticates that Alice and Bob are directly connected. If Eve tried to impersonate Bob to Alice, she would have to intercept quantum states and send her own, but the act of interception would introduce detectable disturbance. Thus, the quantum exchange not only yields a key but also high confidence that no middle-man is present on the quantum link. However, note that this doesn’t tell Alice *which* party she’s connected to—just that whoever it is, the link is clean. Therefore, we still need classical identity authentication to confirm it’s the intended Bob, not some adversary with their own quantum gear on the line. QASWP leverages the quantum exchange’s output `K_quantum` to bootstrap this classical authentication.

### 4.2 Classical Handshake with Post-Quantum Cryptography

After obtaining `K_quantum`, QASWP executes a classical handshake akin to a TLS-like key exchange, but with enhancements:
- **Key Derivation:** Both parties feed `K_quantum` into a KDF (Key Derivation Function) to derive subkeys for use in the handshake. For example, derive an *authentication key* `K_auth` and an *encryption key* `K_encInitial`. The authentication key can be used for HMAC tags on handshake messages, ensuring any tampering is detected immediately.
- **Identity Exchange:** If a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or pre-shared identities are in use, the peers exchange identity information now. For a PKI, this means exchanging certificates containing a public key and identity, and proving ownership of the corresponding private key (usually via a signature).
- **Post-Quantum Signature:** QASWP mandates **post-quantum digital signatures** for identity auth, to remain secure in the quantum era. Candidates include lattice-based signatures like Dilithium (part of NIST’s PQC standardization) or hash-based signatures for shorter-term uses. The ClientHello message includes Alice’s signature on a digest of handshake parameters (including a nonce, protocol version, offered algorithms, and her certificate). Bob responds with his certificate and a signature on corresponding parameters.
- **Key Agreement (Fallback or Hybrid):** If `K_quantum` is available and trusted, it can serve directly as the master session key. However, QASWP optionally performs a parallel **post-quantum key exchange** using algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber or FrodoKEM. This results in `K_classical`, another shared key. The final session key `K_session` can then be a combination (e.g., XOR or hash of `K_quantum` and `K_classical`). This hybrid approach means even if one method is later found weak, the other still provides security (defense in depth).
- **Mutual Proof of Knowledge:** Using `K_auth` derived from the quantum key, both sides can prove they have the same shared secret by exchanging HMACs. For example, Alice sends HMAC(`K_auth`, “Alice|Bob|handshake_data”) and Bob sends HMAC(`K_auth`, “Bob|Alice|handshake_data”). These serve a role similar to the “Finished” messages in TLS, confirming that both computed the same handshake result and that no tampering occurred. Because `K_auth` came from the quantum exchange, this step links the classical and quantum parts: an attacker who didn’t have access to the quantum outcomes can’t forge these HMACs.

At the end of the handshake, the **session keys** are established. Typically, QASWP uses:
- `K_session_enc` – for encrypting semantic data packets.
- `K_session_mac` – for any additional authentication of packets (if not using an integrated AEAD).
- Possibly keys for multiple channels or directions (e.g., one for data from Alice->Bob, one for Bob->Alice) to avoid any theoretical weaknesses in using a single key both ways.

All handshake messages themselves (after the initial hello) can be encrypted or authenticated with keys derived from `K_quantum` as well, ensuring that an attacker cannot modify the negotiation (this is especially important if model parameters or capabilities are being negotiated, as we don’t want an attacker to force a downgrade or a specific model choice for exploit).

### 4.3 Session Encryption and Data Format

Once `K_session_enc` is ready, subsequent communication is encrypted. QASWP does not mandate a specific cipher, but a sensible choice is **AES-256-GCM** (256-bit AES in Galois/Counter Mode), which provides authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD). The associated data can include a packet header (such as a packet sequence number, timestamp, or context identifier) that is not secret but is covered by the authentication tag to prevent replay or reordering attacks.

A typical **QASWP data packet** format:
