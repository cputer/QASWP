## Abstract

The **Quantum-Authenticated Neural Semantic Weaving Protocol (QASWP)**
combines quantum-derived authentication, post-quantum cryptography, and
neural semantic compression to create an AI‑native, quantum‑resilient
transport for the emerging Quantum Internet. A quantum key exchange
(QKD) step bootstraps session secrets and detects active interception.
A classical handshake based on post‑quantum primitives authenticates
endpoints and derives final session keys. Application data is then sent
as **semantic packets**: compact encodings produced by a shared
neural model conditioned on a continuously synchronized context.
Optional zero‑knowledge proofs (zk‑SNARKs) provide verifiable evidence
of protocol and model integrity without revealing private parameters.
We formalize the architecture, derive compression and security
properties, and discuss implementation and performance considerations.

## 1. Introduction

Networks are becoming **meaning‑centric** while cryptographic threats
are becoming **quantum‑capable**. QASWP addresses both by: (i) using a
quantum exchange to seed secrets and confirm channel authenticity;
(ii) using post‑quantum signatures/KEMs for long‑term classical
assurance; and (iii) replacing byte‑level payloads with **context‑aware
semantic codes** generated by a shared model. The result is a protocol
that can approach “send only the uncertainty,” reducing bandwidth on
predictable flows while maintaining strong, future‑proof security.

### 1.1 Goals and Non‑Goals
- **Goals:** end‑to‑end confidentiality/integrity; PQ security;
  bandwidth reduction via semantics; context synchronization; optional
  verifiability of model use; graceful fallback to classical‑only.
- **Non‑Goals:** defining a universal model training process; quantum
  link provisioning; transport reliability (assumed from lower layers).

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
QKD yields a shared secret by measuring quantum states (e.g., BB84/E91)
and detecting eavesdropping via elevated QBER. After error correction
and privacy amplification, endpoints obtain a high‑entropy key `K_q`.

### 2.2 Post‑Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
QASWP uses lattice‑based signatures (e.g., Dilithium) for identity and
KEMs (e.g., Kyber) for hybrid key establishment in addition to `K_q`.

### 2.3 Semantic Communication
Instead of encoding raw bytes, a model `f,g` transmits the **innovation**
relative to shared context `C`. Let `M` be a message and `Z=f(M,C)` a
compact code. The receiver reconstructs `M' = g(Z,C)`. The objective is
to communicate near the conditional entropy `H(M|C)`.

### 2.4 Verifiable AI (ZK‑ML)
Succinct zero‑knowledge proofs can attest that a sender used an
authorized model (matching a published commitment) or correctly ran a
defined computation, without revealing private weights or inputs.

## 3. Architecture Overview

**Layers**
1. **Quantum Exchange:** obtains `K_q`, optionally emits shared random
   seeds for context sync.
2. **Classical Handshake (PQC):** identity auth, capability negotiation
   (model IDs), KDF expansion of keys, optional zk‑proofs.
3. **Semantic Transport:** encrypted **semantic packets** carrying
   model‑encoded payloads and minimal headers.

**Core Components**
- **KeyExchange** (quantum + PQC, transcript binding, KDF).
- **CompressionEngine** (neural encoder/decoder).
- **ContextWeaver** (deterministic context evolution and checkpoints).
- **ProofVerifier** (optional proofs in handshake / on demand).

---

## 4. Cryptographic Design

### 4.1 Key Schedule
After QKD yields `K_q`, derive secrets with a KDF:
```
MS = KDF( label="master", key=K_q || K_pq, transcript )
K_enc, K_mac, K_ctx = Expand(MS, "enc|mac|ctx")
```
`K_pq` is from a PQ KEM (hybrid). Transcript binding prevents downgrade.

### 4.2 Handshake Summary
1) **ClientHello:** version, nonces, model proposals, client cert/ID,
   PQ signature over params, MAC keyed with a derivation from `K_q`.
2) **ServerHello:** selection, server cert/ID, signature, KEM
   encapsulation (if used), MAC.  
3) **Finished:** both sides send a tag over the transcript using keys
   derived from `MS`. Optional zk‑proofs may be carried here.

### 4.3 Record Protection
Packets use AEAD (e.g., AES‑256‑GCM or ChaCha20‑Poly1305) with:
- AAD: header fields (sequence, flags, context‑id, length)
- Ciphertext: semantic payload `Z`
- Tag: integrity/authenticity

Forward secrecy follows from ephemeral quantum outcomes and (optionally)
ephemeral PQ keys; rekey on schedule or after N records.

## 5. Neural Semantic Weaving

### 5.1 Model Interfaces
Encoder `f(M,C)→Z`, decoder `g(Z,C)→M'`. Context evolves deterministically:
```
C_{t+1} = h(C_t, M)
```
Determinism is enforced via fixed precision, seeded RNG, or quantum‑
derived shared randomness.

### 5.2 Information‑Theoretic View
We target:
\[
\text{Comp} = 1 - \frac{H(\Delta \mid \Psi)}{H(M)},
\]
where `Δ` is the corrective delta relative to context `Ψ`. As model
predictive accuracy rises, `H(Δ|Ψ) → 0` and compression approaches 100%.

### 5.3 Quantum‑Assisted Context Sync
Use a small slice of fresh entangled bits to derive common seeds that
steer any stochastic branches of the model, periodically “snapping”
contexts into alignment. This never carries classical data; it is
pre‑agreed coordination on shared randomness.

### 5.4 Resets and Checkpoints
Introduce periodic **I‑frames** (context‑independent packets) and
exchange encrypted context hashes every *K* messages. On mismatch,
perform a reset or replay from last checkpoint.

## 7. Security Analysis

- **Confidentiality:** AEAD over semantic payloads; hybrid `K_q`+PQC
  keys; “record‑now‑decrypt‑later” resistant.
- **Integrity/Authenticity:** PQ signatures in handshake, AEAD tags per
  record, transcript MACs.
- **FS & PCS:** rekeying + ephemeral sources provide forward secrecy and
  post‑compromise safety after rekey.
- **Adversarial ML:** encrypt after compress; optional proofs to attest
  model identity/behavior; context hashes to detect drift.
- **DoS:** cap proof sizes/frequency; rate‑limit unauthenticated work;
  bound context length; fall back or abort on repeated failures.

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

- **Compression benefit** grows with context richness; detect
  incompressible cases and bypass to raw if `|Z| ≥ |M|`.
- **Latency knobs:** model size, quantization, batching, optional proof
  deferral; prefer pre‑computed model proofs.
- **Compute vs Bandwidth trade:** tune for device constraints; offload
  heavy models; exploit hardware crypto.

---

## 9. Implementation Guidance

- Deterministic inference (seed discipline, numerics).
- Separate model weights from per‑session context; support multiple
  contexts via small IDs.
- Strong KDF binding to transcript; strict parameter negotiation.
- Clear alerting/abort semantics; comprehensive fuzzing and state‑
  machine tests.

## 10. Conclusion

QASWP fuses quantum authentication, PQ crypto, semantic compression, and
verifiable AI into a single transport. It provides strong security
properties with substantial bandwidth savings for context‑rich traffic,
and a practical migration path via classical‑only fallback. Future work
includes multi‑party contexts, model update protocols, and hardware‑
accelerated proving for ZK‑ML.
