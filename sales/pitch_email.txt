Subject: QASWP (Demo-Verified): 99% Compression on Repeated Flows + PQ Session â€” Pilot Discussion

Hi <Name>,

We've published a demo-verified version of QASWP. In CI it shows:
- 99%+ compression on repeated flows,
- shared-session keys in simulation,
- deterministic entanglement-id sync stub,
- succinct 64B verification.

Proposal: small pilot on predictable traffic. Repo + badges attached.
